# DataCamp Projects
My solutions to the DataCamp Projects. These are side projects I have been working on to develop my skills in Python and SQL mainly, but hopefully I'll start to get a feel for R also.  
Let me know if these have been helpful to you!  

**Projects:** 
- Classify Song Genres from Audio Data (Python)
- Exploring 67 years of LEGO (Python)
