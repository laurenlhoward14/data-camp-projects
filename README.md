# DataCamp Projects
My solutions to the DataCamp Projects. These are side projects I have been working on to develop my skills in Python and SQL mainly, but hopefully I'll start to get a feel for R also.  
Each project is linked to the page (you may need a DataCamp account to access this)

Let me know if these have been helpful to you!
